# pet-rescue-demo
# A small test project in Javascript.
# Mainly based on the "Pet Rescue" project on SkillCrush (https://skillcrush.com/blog/projects-you-can-do-with-javascript/#pet), but I've made some adjustments - mainly, the
# output of the code is now on the page itself, rather than the console.
